# This is a repository describing my new learnings from datasets and the techniques I used on them

- #Day0:
          -> Creating projects timeline
          
          -> Setting up Ubuntu and CUDA (2 years ago it was stll a hassle & today it still is)
          
          -> Installing packages and libraries
          
          -> Setting up my music playlist
          
          -> Uninstall Instagram (My hatred for time-wasting social media knows no bounds)
          
- [Data preprocessing](Basics\practice/2.\Data\preprocessing/Data\preprocessing.ipynb) - 80% time of a Data scientist goes, or at least should go doing this (Pareto principle everywhere)

          -> Importing dataset
          
          -> Handling missing data
          
          -> Encoding categorical data
          
          -> Splitting into training set and test set
          
          -> Feature scaling
          
- [Linear Regression](3.\Simple\Linear\Regression/Simple\Linear\Regression.ipynb)
          
          -> Predicted salaries of employees based on their experience

- [Multivariable Linear Regression](Basics\practice/4.\Multiple\Linear\Regression/Multiple\Linear\Regression.ipynb)

          -> Encoding categorical data
          
          -> Label Encoder
          
          -> One hot Encoder
          
          -> Feature scaling
          
          -> Predicted profit based on multiple independent features.
          
- [Boston house pricing](Basics\practice/5.\Boston\Pricing/Boston\pricing.ipynb)

          -> used DESCR to describe the data
          
          -> Mean, median, Standard deviation analysis
          
          -> Plotted real values v/s predicted values to get an idea of the prediction
          
- [Polynomial regression](Basics\practice/6.\Polynomial\Regression\polynomial_regression.py)

          -> Learned about Polynomial regression and how it's degree affects the curve
          
- [Principal Component Analysis](Basics\practice/7.\Cancer\dataset/Cancer_PCA.ipynb)

          -> Performed PCA on Cancer dataset
