## Day 1: Text preprocessing
- Like any data science problem, understand the questions that are being asked will inform what steps may be employed to transform words into numerical features that work with machine learning algorithms.
- None of the magic described above happens without a lot of work on the back end
- We have to spend more time in cleaning the data to get better results.
- Cleaning consist of getting rid of the less useful parts of text through stopword removal, dealing with capitalization and characters and other details.
- I have created a demo example to preprocess text.
